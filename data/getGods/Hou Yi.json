From whence none knew, ten suns rose above the horizon. Such incessant light and heat ravaged the earth, wilting fields of grain, drying rivers, even melting forged metal. Bent beneath the scorching rays, the people begged the Emperor-God Di Jun to aid them. In reply, he called the great archer, Hou Yi.\\n\\nArmed with a mystical red bow and a quiver of white arrows, Hou Yi traveled to Earth. What he found was a barren land. Shielding his eyes, he peered to the sky where the ten suns cruelly flared.\\n\\nNocking arrow to bow, Hou Yi loosed a warning at the suns hoping to frighten them away, but they impassively remained. So Hou Yi drew again and fired a killing shot. Pierced, the sun exploded in color and a giant red raven with three legs fell to the earth, slain by the white arrow.\\n\\nEight times more Hou Yi drew arrow to cheek. Eight shots more he let fly. Eight more bursts rent the sky, and eight more ravens fell dead. But one sun he left, and so fearful of Hou Yi's archery, this sun behaved, dipping below the horizon.\\n\\nNow armed with the power of the red ravens he smote, sending light and fire against those that threaten the world, be it monster or beast, dragon or sun, man or God, Hou Yi is the Defender of the Earth.","MP5PerLevel":0.35,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":240,"ManaPerFive":5,"ManaPerLevel":38,"Name":"Hou Yi","OnFreeRotation":"true","Pantheon":"Chinese","PhysicalPower":40,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.8,"PhysicalProtection":13,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"Pros":" High Area Damage, High Single Target Damage","Roles":" Hunter","Speed":370,"Title":"Defender of the Earth","Type":" Ranged, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"10s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Hou Yi fires a powerful shot that can ricochet off of walls.

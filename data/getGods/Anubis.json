From that union, Anubis was born. Osiris cared for Anubis as his own, but when Osiris was murdered by his evil brother, Set, Anubis embalmed his adopted father and mummified the corpse so he would not rot. This preservation passed down to the Faithful, for if it was good enough for the Gods, it was good enough for man.\\n\\nNone enter the abyss of the Underworld without first being tested by Anubis. When corpses are preserved, he is the embalmer. When time for judgment comes, he is the final arbiter. In his realm, he keeps legendary weighing scales. On one side, the massive weight of Ma’at – truth and order. On the other side, he places the heart of the deceased. Should the weight of Ma’at prove infinitely heavier than that of the heart, Anubis casts the soul deep into the darkness of the Underworld, where it is forgotten, never to be reborn.","MP5PerLevel":0.36,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":175,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":280,"ManaPerFive":4.8,"ManaPerLevel":58,"Name":"Anubis","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Egyptian","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":10,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.5,"Pros":" High Area Damage","Roles":" Mage","Speed":360,"Title":"God of the Dead","Type":" Ranged, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"15/14/13/12/11s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"A plague of locusts bellows forth from Anubis' mouth, smothering all enemies in the area and doing damage every .5s for 3s.

She sent signs and missives to reject him, but Zhou would not be dissuaded. At night, he slipped into her temple and scrawled poetry across the walls espousing his undying love. This defilement could not go unanswered. Nu Wa summoned the most conniving and wicked Fox Spirit she could and thrust it upon the Emperor with intent to spiral his life into misery. Little did Nu Wa know what she had just unleashed.\\n\\nFor thousands of years the nine-tailed Fox spirit had lived, biding its time, honing its malicious appetites. Finally in human form, it assumed the irresistible guise of Da Ji, and to Emperor Zhou, she could do no wrong.\\n\\nWith free reign of the Empire and its people, Da Ji reveled in torture and malice. She took delight in their screams of pain as she danced to playful music composed at her command, the musicians trembling for every note.\\n\\nSo grievous did these atrocities grow that the people rose up and overthrew their ruler. They stormed the gates, toppled the throne, and pursued Zhou to his bed chamber, where the crazed emperor finally took his own life.\\n\\nYet, Da Ji managed to escape and conceal herself. Now she joins the fray, not to save the universe, nor empower her pantheon, but instead to soak up every last cry of anguish from her enemies.","MP5PerLevel":0.37,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":210,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Da Ji","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Chinese","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.25,"PhysicalProtection":14,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Single Target Damage","Roles":" Assassin","Speed":375,"Title":"The Nine-Tailed Fox","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"9s","cost":"50","description":"Da Ji heats up her claws, causing her next successfully hit Basic Attack to burn the target, dealing instant bonus damage, additional damage every 1s for 3s and Slowing them for 3s.

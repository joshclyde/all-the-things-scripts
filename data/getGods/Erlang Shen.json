Yet the true  source of the disaster proved to be an evil dragon. With seven companions, Erlang Shen ambushed the beast. Cowardly and quick the dragon slithered into the rapid river waters, but Erlang Shen captured it with a great chain and bound it beneath a shrine. Thus the floods subsided.\\n\\nWhen Sun Wukongâ€™s troublesome antics drew the ire of the Jade Emperor, Erlang Shen faced the Monkey King on the battlefield. For every form Sun Wukong took, Erlang Shen transformed as well. Across sea and sky and land they battled. Thus was Sun Wukong sent fleeing for his life.\\n\\nWhen the people were plagued by demons and monsters, Erlang Shen slaughtered them to keep his countrymen safe. Three-bladed spear in hand and hunting dog at his side, no evil could threaten the innocent or the Empire. Thus, Erlang came to be loved and worshipped.\\n\\nA Goddess mother and a mere mortal father, he is of two worlds. He is both sage and a soldier, humble yet regal, his veins filled with the blood of men and the divine blood of his uncle, the Jade Emperor. Having risen above his forbidden origins, Erlang Shen has proven himself among the greatest of heroes in the Jade Empire. Perhaps that is why he now takes the field. No demon, nor dragon, nor even the Monkey King himself has stood against him and won. To save the people, to save the world, Erlang Shen will fight, and another legend will be born!","MP5PerLevel":0.3,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":220,"ManaPerFive":4.7,"ManaPerLevel":35,"Name":"Erlang Shen","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Chinese","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2,"PhysicalProtection":17,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Single Target Damage, High Attack Speed","Roles":" Warrior","Speed":375,"Title":"The Illustrious Sage","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"60","description":"Erlang Shen opens his third eye and analyzes the enemy's strengths and weaknesses.

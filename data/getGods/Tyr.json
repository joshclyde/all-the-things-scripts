The embodiment of mankind’s impossible ideals. Man is a malleable creature, but a God is stone, shaped only by the harsh weather of expectation. And none have a greater burden of expectation than Tyr, for he is Courage. He is Honor. He is Justice.\\n\\nCourage is not the absence of fear, but the will to face the frightening.\\n\\nFenrir, the mighty wolf, was foretold to wreak such devastation on the Gods that they sought to bind him. Tyr, clothed in courage, brought the beast to their prison, where the Gods prepared shackles.\\n\\nHonor is not a stubborn oath, but the integrity to uphold what is right, even when it is not easy.\\n\\nUnder the guise of a test of strength, twice the Gods bound Fenrir, and twice he broke free. On the third attempt, Fenrir sensed a trick and demanded one of the Gods place their hand into his mouth. If the binding proved magical, Fenrir would take the hand. Tyr agreed.\\n\\nJustice is not adherence to the law, but a code of fairness and morality.\\n\\nBound by the mystical ribbon, Fenrir devoured Tyr’s hand. It was the price to be paid. And Tyr paid it willingly. Even Fenrir deserved justice.\\n\\nOne handed, Tyr is worshipped as a pinnacle of righteousness, called upon for valor in battle, balance in law, and the fortitude to face the impossible. As the cloud of war blackens the world, and fear grips the people, Tyr is stooped by the weight of expectation. With blade in hand, he takes the field. For he is Courage. He is Honor. He is Justice.","MP5PerLevel":0.29,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":230,"ManaPerFive":4.4,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Tyr","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Norse","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2,"PhysicalProtection":18,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Defense, Medium Crowd Control","Roles":" Warrior","Speed":375,"Title":"the Lawgiver","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"15s","cost":"50/55/60/65/70","description":"Tyr charges forward, immune to Knockup, damaging enemies.\r\nAssault Stance: Tyr pushes all enemies along with him, hitting them 2 times and knocking them up in the air.\r\nGuard Stance: Tyr hits each enemy only once, passing through and knocking them up in the air.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Dash"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"},{"description":"Radius:","value":"12"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Assault Damage:","value":"40/90/140/190/240 (+50% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Guard Damage:","value":"70/120/170/220/270 (+50% of your Physical Power)"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"12/11/10/9/8s","cost":"50","description":"Tyr makes a massive melee attack, hitting all enemies within a 180 degree cone.\n\nAssault Stance: Enemies that are knocked up in the air are knocked away.\n\nGuard Stance: Tyr heals himself for each enemy hit (max 3).","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Cone"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"},{"description":"Cone:","value":"180"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"80/115/150/185/220 (+65% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Healing:","value":"20/45/70/95/120 (+20% of your Physical Power)"}]}},"abilityDescription3":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"12/12/11/11/10s","cost":"","description":"Tyr changes between Assault and Guard stances.

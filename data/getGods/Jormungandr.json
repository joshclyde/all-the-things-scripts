Among these days of judgement, none are eclipsed in their scale of horror and destruction foretold of more than Ragnarok, the prophesied disaster of the Norse pantheon.\\n\\nThere is a single being who acts as the herald of Ragnarok, the god known as Jormungandr, the World Serpent. A son of Loki, he is an immense, serpentine dragon, massive enough to encircle the entire world and blot the light from the sun. Dark omens are whispered of when the World Serpent will rise, casting his noxious poisons out to engulf the whole of the earth.\\n\\nThe time Jormungandr bestrides the earth is one of unmatched calamity, the days of Ragnarok where the oceans boil and the land quakes. They are days of incredible violence, where both mortal and divine blood shall soak the ground, and the World Serpent will mete out destruction with a fanaticâ€™s zeal. He will swim through the earth and seas alike with vast snapping jaws and caustic venom, sweeping away any opponent brave enough to stand against him.\\n\\nOne such champion is Thor, the mighty God of Thunder. Long has his destiny been written that he will confront the World Serpent in the nightmarish days of Ragnarok. It is a clash that will shake creation, rivalling any battle in history, and one that neither Thor nor Jormungandr may ever walk away from.\\n\\nWoe to any who hears the trumpets of Ragnarok, for they herald the coming of Jormungandr, the instrument of their annihilation.

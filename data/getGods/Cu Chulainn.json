A warrior without equal that, alone, held an army at bay; a man of will and courage that resisted both the allure and wrath of the Morrigan; a figure of tragic prophecy, destined for greatness and an early grave. So many legends are there of his achievements they could be spoken for days and yet still more be told. And yet throughout his triumphs, his death loomed constant, foretold and certain.\\n\\nIn his early years, while still bearing the name Sétanta, he was already an impressive individual, catching the attention of King Conchobar with feats of strength and agility. Conchobar invited the boy to a feast hosted by the smith, Culann. Left unchained by mistake, Culann’s fearsome guard dog assailed Sétanta when he arrived. With only his bare hands, the boy defended himself and slew the beast. Ashamed, Sétanta swore to Culann he would personally train a new dog and would guard his home in the interim. Impressed, the druid Cathbad declared Sétanta would now be called the Cú Chulainn, the Hound of Culann.\\n\\nThis was the birth of a hero, but his death was yet bound in prophecy. Cathbad, the same druid that named him, promised a group of boys, “Any that take up arms this day will become legends.” Seeking greatness, Cú Chulainn raced off to find weapons before hearing more. He saw years of victory, of achieving the impossible, of becoming a legend before him. Cathbad, however, was devastated, for he knew that those that took up arms that day were also foretold to die young.","MP5PerLevel":0,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":100,"ManaPerFive":0,"ManaPerLevel":0,"Name":"Cu Chulainn","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Celtic","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2,"PhysicalProtection":17,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Area Damage, High Crowd Control","Roles":" Warrior","Speed":370,"Title":"Hound of Ulster","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16/15/14/13/12s","cost":"9 Rage","description":"Cu Chulainn thrusts his spear forward, damaging all enemies in front of him and stunning less powerful minions.

Where he came from or why is truly unknown, but if there’s a way for him to stir the pot between any two gods, he’ll do it. He’s a master of gossip and coy, backhanded compliments. And yet, all the Gods come to him for news. His home on the trunk of Yggdrasil conveniently places Ratatoskr at the center of all cosmic activity.\\n\\nAs Gods from every Pantheons clash, how could Ratatoskr pass up the opportunity to instigate new rivalries?

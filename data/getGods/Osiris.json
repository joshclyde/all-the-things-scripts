Son of the Earth God, Geb, Osiris was divine royalty by birth, and all the land his birthright. Benevolence and prosperity were the hallmarks of his reign. Would that he had been left to shape the world, but the jealousy of his brother, Set, changed the course of fate.\\n\\nSeeking to usurp the throne, Set deceived and murdered his brother, tearing his body to pieces and casting them across the land. Isis, Osirisâ€™ wife, secretly fled while Set plunged the kingdom into darkness. For years she toiled to reassemble her husband while his spirit form, his Ba, endured. Yet for all her searching, she could not find every part of him, and Isis was forced to reanimate Osiris without. Though not strong enough to defy Set in this incomplete form, Osiris gave Isis a son that would topple the tyrant Set and restore balance to Egypt.\\n\\nWhat remains of Osiris is a fragment of what he once was. Robbed of his crown over the earth, he now governs the realm of the dead with the same benevolence he ruled the living. But darkness looms again, and though broken, Osiris refuses to sit idly by. Mustering the last of his strength and spirit, Osiris seeks to change the course of fate, this time for the light over darkness.","MP5PerLevel":0.39,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":230,"ManaPerFive":4.7,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Osiris","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Egyptian","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.25,"PhysicalProtection":17,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Defense, High Attack Speed","Roles":" Warrior","Speed":375,"Title":"Broken God of the Afterlife","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"5s","cost":"30","description":"Osiris throws his Sickle forward.

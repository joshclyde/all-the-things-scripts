What would you sacrifice, whose blood would you be willing to spill? For the god Set, he would pay any price, even the blood of his own brother, Osiris.\\n\\nSet saw the tyrannical control his brother held over the land, the hoarding of strength and power even from his own son. He looked to that son, fair Horus, starved of the means to take the reigns of command when his appointed time came, incapable of leading them into any future but darkness. Set looked upon an unworthy king, and a worse successor, and he chose to act.\\n\\nHe knew the world would seek to damn him, to decry his deeds as those of a murderer, slavering for power. But Set would endure such lies, to save his kingdom. He would seize the throne back from the unworthy and the weak, from the sinister and the corrupt, and in time, when the truth of the world mirrored the truth he desired in his heart, they would throng the streets to praise him. Set would be their deliverance, no matter the cost.","MP5PerLevel":0.38,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":210,"ManaPerFive":4.2,"ManaPerLevel":38,"Name":"Set","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Egyptian","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.3,"PhysicalProtection":13,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.9,"Pros":" High Single Target Damage","Roles":" Assassin","Speed":375,"Title":"The Usurper","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"8s","cost":"40/45/50/55/60","description":"Set amasses his hatred, throwing it forward.

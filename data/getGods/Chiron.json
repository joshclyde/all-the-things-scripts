Two opposites in one form. For all appearances, he is a centaur, bearing the torso of a man, and the body of a horse. Brutish, crude, and violent, the centaurs are not civilized creatures. Yet, Chiron is a scholar, a poet, an astrologer, and a teacher. And for all the wonder and glory of the world he tries to impart upon his illustrious students, Chiron, it seems, must constantly teach them the art of war. \\n\\nFame and legend are the hallmarks of his pupils. Perseus, who beheaded Medusa, Ajax, who battled bravely against Troy, and Achilles, who Chiron practically raised from infancy, all are figures of renown. But it is for their acts of violence, not art or science, for which songs are sung of these heroes. Chiron would prefer the world a more contemplative place where mankind adored nature and kindled bonds of friendship over scholarly discussions. \\n\\nThough, to his wizened eyes, the brink has been reached and the world he finds so fascinating tilts toward annihilation. Set aside are his books and scrolls, the easel and brush, and taken up are his bow and armor. On thunderous hooves Chiron gallops to the field. To save all that he holds dear, Chiron, the Great Teacher, will go to war.","MP5PerLevel":0.38,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":225,"ManaPerFive":4.4,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Chiron","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Greek","PhysicalPower":35,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.35,"PhysicalProtection":12,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"Pros":" High Sustain, High Movement Speed","Roles":" Hunter","Speed":380,"Title":"The Great Teacher","Type":" Ranged, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"13s","cost":"55/60/65/70/75","description":"Chiron warns his teammates to evade the area, granting them .3s of Crowd Control Immunity so they can escape before it explodes and does damage to all enemies in the area.\n\nApplies Target Mark","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Ground Target"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemies and Allies"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"},{"description":"Radius:","value":"17.5"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"80/135/190/245/300 (+80% of your Physical Power)"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16s","cost":"65","description":"Chiron passively marks his enemies as targets when he damages them with Basic Attacks, Training Exercise, or Centaurus, reducing their Physical Protections by 5%.\r\nHe may activate this ability to fire seeking arrows at all marked targets within range, damaging and slowing them.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Instant"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy Gods"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"55/90/125/160/195 (+70% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Mark Duration:","value":"3.5s"},{"description":"Slow:","value":"25/27.5/30/32.5/35%"},{"description":"Slow Duration:","value":"2s"}]}},"abilityDescription3":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16s","cost":"70/75/80/85/90","description":"Chiron gallops forward damaging enemies, knocking up minions, and kicking enemy gods behind him.\nChiron may fire Basic Attacks while charging.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Dash"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemies"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"70/95/120/145/170 (+50% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Bonus Power:","value":"10/20/30/40/50"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"90s","cost":"80/90/100/110/120","description":"Chiron is transformed into a constellation, and can fire three long-distance shots, even through walls.\nIf Chiron would be killed during this ability, he does not die until he runs out of time or shots.

Reserved, secretive, Ullr does not represent the tankard downing, boast bellowing contemporaries of the Norse Pantheon, but pays respectful tribute to glory in all its forms.\\n\\nGlory is in the silence of snowfall, in the honorable victory earned from single combat, in the perfect curve of a yew bow firing an arrow true. Dotted across the lands of the Faithful, shrines to Ullr can be found in remote, secluded hideaways. It is there that glory is found in the sanctity of a vow, once sworn, never broken, and bound by a ring, no matter how crude, then buried in the earth to weather the ages of time.\\n\\nThough rarely spoken of, he is highly regarded, even among the Gods, for it is Ullr, not one of Odin’s sons that tends the throne of Asgard while the All Father is away. Other Gods might use the opportunity to abuse the power, but Ullr’s rule is merely an extension thereof. So much so that only the innermost circle even know that Odin is gone.\\n\\nAll the more noticeable is it, then, that Ullr has abandoned this post to join the fray. Early on did Odin take the field of battle, leaving Ullr to manage the kingdom. So great a threat must this war be as to endanger the very survival of Asgard. Whatever the reason, Ullr comes to preserve glory, which, for him, may be the whole world.","MP5PerLevel":0.38,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":230,"ManaPerFive":4.4,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Ullr","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Norse","PhysicalPower":38,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.4,"PhysicalProtection":13,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Sustain","Roles":" Hunter","Speed":360,"Title":"The Glorious One","Type":" Ranged, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"50/55/60/65/70","description":"Ranged: Ullr fires a bladed arrow in a line, dealing damage and passing through all targets it hits.\n\nMelee: Ullr throws an axe in a line, hitting a single target dealing damage and Stunning it.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Line"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage (Bow):","value":"80/130/180/230/280 (+70% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Damage (Axe):","value":"50/80/110/140/170 (+65% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Stun Duration (Axe):","value":"1/1.1/1.2/1.3/1.4s"}]}},"abilityDescription2":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16s","cost":"50","description":"Ranged: Ullr gains bonus Physical Power for 5s.\n\nMelee: Ullr gains bonus move speed for 5s.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Physical Power (Bow):","value":"25/30/35/40/45"},{"description":"Move Speed (Axe):","value":"20/25/30/35/40%"},{"description":"Duration:","value":"5s"}]}},"abilityDescription3":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"15s","cost":"60","description":"Ranged: Ullr fires a volley at his target location, dealing damage.\n\nMelee: Ullr leaps to his target location, dealing damage in an AoE on arrival.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Ground Target"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy"},{"description":"Damage:","value":"Physical"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Damage (Bow):","value":"80/120/160/200/240 (0% of your Physical Power)"},{"description":"Damage (Axe):","value":"50/80/110/140/170 (+50% of your Physical Power)"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"1s","cost":"0","description":"Ullr changes stance.\n\nRanged: Ullr uses his yew bow, removing Disarms and gaining additional attack speed.\n\nMelee: Ullr uses his axes, removing Disarms and gaining additional Physical Lifesteal.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Attack Speed (Bow):","value":"5/10/15/20/25%"},{"description":"Physical Lifesteal (Axe):","value":"5/10/15/20/25%"}]}},"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"","cost":"","description":"When Ullr uses an ability in either stance his Cooldowns in the opposite stance are reduced.","menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}],"rankitems":[{"description":"Cooldown Reduction:","value":"1s"}]}},"basicAttack":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"","cost":"","description":"","menuitems":[{"description":"Damage:","value":"38 + 2.4/Lvl (+100% of Physical Power)"},{"description":"Progression:","value":"None"}],"rankitems":[]}},"godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/bladed-arrow.jpg","godAbility2_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/expose-weakness.jpg","godAbility3_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/hail-of-arrows.jpg","godAbility4_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/wield-axes.jpg","godAbility5_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/weapon-master.jpg","godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/ullr.jpg","godIcon_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-icons/ullr.jpg","id":1991,"latestGod":"n","ret_msg":null}

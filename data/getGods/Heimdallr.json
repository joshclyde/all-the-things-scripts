And no guardian is more steadfast in their duties than keen-eyed Heimdallr, sentinel of the Bifrost. The watchman of Asgard is a sentry without equal in the Nine Realms and he maintains his eternal watch where the rainbow bridge meets the sky. With sharp eyes and keen hearing, Heimdallr stands guard over the halls of the gods, alert for the approach of any enemy as well as the first stirrings of Ragnarok.\\n\\nIt is said that Heimdallr requires less sleep than a bird, and can see for hundreds of leagues. His hearing is so sharp that he can perceive the soft whisper of growing grass, and the murmur of the dead. His trumpet, Gjallarhorn, can be heard across the Nine Worlds when blown. But it is not only his senses which make Heimdallr a superb sentinel.\\n\\nHe also possesses the gift of foresight, allowing him to predict his opponent’s moves before they occur and to sense the approach of inimical forces. As befitting one of the Aesir, he is a masterful combatant, and his foreknowledge gives him an edge over all but the most unpredictable – or skilled – of opponents.\\n\\nToo, it is whispered that Heimdallr has some connection to Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Some insist he was fashioned whole from a splinter of the great ash tree, while others believe he is bound to it in some fashion, much like Ratatoskr. Whatever the case, it is known that Heimdallr takes a dim view of any who might threaten Yggdrasil.\\n\\nThus, when his keen gaze settled upon the creeping tendrils of Persephone’s minions, drawing ever closer to the World Tree, Heimdallr moved instantly to confront them. Powerful as she was, even the Queen of the Underworld could not hide her intentions from the watchman of Asgard… ","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":230,"ManaPerFive":4.5,"ManaPerLevel":34,"Name":"Heimdallr","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Norse","PhysicalPower":32,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":3,"PhysicalProtection":16,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Single Target Damage","Roles":" Hunter","Speed":365,"Title":"The Vigilant","Type":" Ranged, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"50/55/60/65/70","description":"Heimdallr throws his sword, Hofuð, into the air.

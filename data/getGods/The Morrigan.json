Individually, these three Goddesses were sisters, progenitors of sovereignty, war, and death. They were caretakers of their lush green Éire, champions for armored soldiers, guides for the deceased. It is unknown what bound them together. Some whispered curse, some lover’s scorn. Some dark power or darker purposes.  But now they are one.\\n\\nShe’s been seen in many shapes. The lurid seductress, the wrinkled hag, the screaming crow, and worst of all, the washer in the river. For those who witness her cleaning their bloody armor prophesies a violent end.\\n\\nSubtle and manipulative, there is no war The Morrigan did not incite. No dying breath she did not collect.

Shiva's boon grants the demon-king invulnerability against gods and beasts. Only mortal men stand a chance of defeating him, but Ravana's might is too potent for a mere man to overcome. All seems lost.\\n\\nTo save us, Vishnu took human form. Rama, prince of Ayodhya.\\n\\nAt age 16 he was already the perfect embodiment of man. Strong, humble, handsome, patient, devout; he is what mankind strives to be, yet, for all our flaws, can never reach.\\n\\nWhen a neighboring kingdom, cursed by Ravana's magic, asked for aid, Rama answered, despite the misgivings of his father. With his brother Laksharma, Rama set out and slew a horde of demons. At the palace, Rama cleansed the curse by freeing the queen from stone. The city celebrated and Rama was invited to string Shiva's bow â€“ with the prize princess Sita's hand in marriage. Shiva's bow could not be lifted by any man, let alone strung, but Rama broke the bow in half. He and Sita wed immediately.\\n\\nReturning home, Rama was to be crown prince, but the jealousy of queen Kaikeyi forced Rama into exile, where he's remained these past fourteen years.\\n\\nYet Rama was recently seen on the field of battle. Word is, Ravana stole Rama's wife, and Rama left exile to embrace his destiny. He must defeat Ravana, free his wife, and set mankind on a path for peace, else darkness and evil will conquer all.","MP5PerLevel":0.25,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":205,"ManaPerFive":4.5,"ManaPerLevel":34,"Name":"Rama","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Hindu","PhysicalPower":40,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.5,"PhysicalProtection":12,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"Pros":" High Mobility, High Attack Speed","Roles":" Hunter","Speed":370,"Title":"Seventh Avatar of Vishnu","Type":" Ranged, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"","cost":"20 + 1 arrow per shot","description":"Rama switches to a more powerful arrow that Pierces and Slows enemies.

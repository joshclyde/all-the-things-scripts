Those who worship Pele speak of her as Madame Pele or Tutu Pele, while others know her as Ka wahine ‘ai honua, ‘the woman who devours the land’. Though she is capable of great acts of destruction, and possesses the temper to provoke such acts, Pele is both destroyer and creator. It was through her mastery over the world’s molten core that she wrought the Hawaiian Islands into being, forging them from the lava that ruptured forth from the mouths of her volcanoes. They are places of immense beauty, lush and brimming with life, and by looking upon and revelling in such beauty, you offer Pele worship.\\n\\nBorn of Kane Milohai, who wrought the earth, sky and heavens, and the Earth goddess Haumea, Pele is one of fourteen children, seven sisters and seven brothers. It is from the enmity between these siblings that Pele arrived in Hawaii, after her exile at the hands of Kane Milohai for her fiery temper and conflict with her sister Namakaokahai, goddess of the Sea. Pursued across the oceans by Namakaikahai, Pele wrought Hawaii into a paradise, making her home within the great calderas of the volcanoes that stand sentinel across the island chain.\\n\\nTo worship Pele is to grant one’s devotion to a goddess of terrible power, one who can shape and render a grand, vibrant world into being at her slightest whim, and burn it to ashes just as quickly. But just as her worshippers are devoted to Pele, she devotes herself to them as a force of divine protection and care. She is a tireless defender of life and the people that dwell upon her islands, and any that seek to threaten them shall surely taste Pele’s fire.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":240,"ManaPerFive":4.3,"ManaPerLevel":40,"Name":"Pele","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Polynesian","PhysicalPower":39,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.25,"PhysicalProtection":12,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.9,"Pros":" High Single Target Damage","Roles":" Assassin","Speed":375,"Title":"Goddess of Volcanoes","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"14s","cost":"40/45/50/55/60","description":"Pele flourishes and fires out a magma orb ahead of her in a line.

Agni, God of Fire, is the embodiment of both of these qualities, with a head for each.\\n\\nThough the source of his origin warrants debate - for there are many tales of his parentage ranging from two simple sticks rubbed together, to the cosmic energy that made all things at the beginning of time - Agni is a pivotal and important God with many duties to the Pantheon. He is the twin brother to Indra, God of the Heavens and Rains and chief among warriors. Conversely, Agni is chief among priests, acting as messenger between mortals and Gods. Every Hindu ritual and prayer is performed in front of a fire of some kind, so Agni carries the words and sacrifices, traveling between the Earth and the Heavens. He is welcome in every home and every hearth and much beloved by the Faithful.\\n\\nThrough his flames, Agni provides heat and light, but also cleanses impurities. Smoke from his pyres create the air and hold the Heavens aloft. The sun, a source of fire itself, brings life-giving energy to the world, and his lightning streaks the sky during storms.\\n\\nFor all his kindness and service, Agni has two faces. One is the face of kindness and purity, turned towards the people and Gods. His other face, grim and resolute, guides the God of Fire, to play his role in the cosmic cycle of creation and destruction, to burn and blacken all the atrocities of the world to ash.","MP5PerLevel":0.37,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":170,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":255,"ManaPerFive":4.7,"ManaPerLevel":45,"Name":"Agni","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Hindu","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":11,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.6,"Pros":" High Area Damage","Roles":" Mage","Speed":355,"Title":"God of Fire","Type":" Ranged, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"12s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Agni summons a cloud of noxious fumes at his ground target location, doing damage every second.

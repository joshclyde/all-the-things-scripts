They're guarded by aged Sylvanus, a benevolent spirit of nature, whose glittering eyes and easy grin match the vibrant life that grows in these lands.\\n\\nCompanion to all woodland creatures, both mundane and fantastic, Sylvanus has been seen with fawn and wolf, nymph and satyr, and even trees come to life. He protects and nurtures those that respect his domain.\\n\\nWhen the boy Cyparissus went traveling with his pet deer, Sylvanus accidently allowed wolves to hunt the peaceful animal. So stricken with grief at the loss of his pet, the child succumbed to despair and died. Wracked with guilt, Sylvanus transformed the child into the Cypress tree, whose sap weeps like the saddened child.\\n\\nOld and wise, Sylvanus views the passing of time with ease and understanding. His laughter is the wind in the leaves, his touch the sprout of flowers from the earth, and his voice the call to calm the most savage beast. He is slow to anger and slower to act, which is why his presence on the battlefield is so strange. As the war between Gods spills into the idyllic realms Sylvanus keeps, he is left with no choice but fight back.","MP5PerLevel":0.4,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":175,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":7.5,"Mana":190,"ManaPerFive":4.6,"ManaPerLevel":34,"Name":"Sylvanus","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Roman","PhysicalPower":0,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":0,"PhysicalProtection":19,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"Pros":" High Crowd Control, High Sustain","Roles":" Guardian","Speed":365,"Title":"Keeper of the Wild","Type":" Ranged, Magical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"16/15/14/13/12s","cost":"60/65/70/75/80","description":"Sylvanus throws a seed to a target location.

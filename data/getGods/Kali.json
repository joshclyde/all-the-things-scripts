The first, Durga, the Mother of Creation, was as radiant as she was fearsome. Astride her tiger, she scattered the demon horde until she encountered the horrendous Raktabija. For each wound she gave the demon, his cursed blood created a copy, quickly resulting in an unstoppable army of Raktabija clones. Rage boiled at the corners of Durga’s mind, in the quest to slaughter and destroy evil.  From the forehead of Durga sprung her wrathful form, with skin darkened and eyes glowing a menacing red.\\n\\nThus was Kali, the Black One, Goddess of Time and Destruction, the second form of Devi born.\\n\\nRarely has Kali been seen since, kept in the shadows of Devi’s mind, but when the tides of battle shift and evil looms large, there is no solution but unrestrained destruction of evil, and Kali once again, walks the Earth.","MP5PerLevel":0.21,"MagicProtection":30,"MagicProtectionPerLevel":0.9,"MagicalPower":0,"MagicalPowerPerLevel":0,"Mana":205,"ManaPerFive":4.3,"ManaPerLevel":34,"Name":"Kali","OnFreeRotation":"","Pantheon":"Hindu","PhysicalPower":37,"PhysicalPowerPerLevel":2.32,"PhysicalProtection":15,"PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.9,"Pros":" High Single Target Damage, High Sustain","Roles":" Assassin","Speed":375,"Title":"Goddess of Destruction","Type":" Melee, Physical","abilityDescription1":{"itemDescription":{"cooldown":"12s","cost":"70","description":"Kali leaps forward, damaging enemies in the target area.
